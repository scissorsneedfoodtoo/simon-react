Created as the final freeCodeCamp advanced front end development project. My goal was to model [this](http://www.retro-computing.org/exhibit-photos/227/lg__MG_5980.jpg) version of Milton Bradley's Pocket Simon as closely as possible using React. The [Waiting For Friday](http://www.waitingforfriday.com/?p=586#Sound_frequencies_and_timing) page on reverse engineering the physical version of the game was invaluable for coding the various sound frequencies and timings into the game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
